# Movies-ETL

## Overview

Amazing Prime hosted a 'hack-a-thon' for finding ways to create an automated pipeline that takes in data, performs appropriate transformations, and load it into existing tables.
The three data files used are found in the Resoursources folder (Note: the 'ratings.csv' file referenced in the code was sampled into its 1000 lines and included as 'rating.csv').

- Data Sources: 
  - ratings.csv
